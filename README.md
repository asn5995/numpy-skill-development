# NumPy Skill Development

This repository contains focused NumPy learning sprints designed to build fluency in numerical computing and array manipulation ‚Äî critical foundations for data science, quantitative research, and financial modeling.

## ‚úÖ Modules Completed

- **Module 1:** Array Creation & Manipulation  
- **Module 2:** Slicing, Reshaping, Flattening  
- **Module 3:** Logic Operations & Conditional Masking  
- **Module 4:** Random Sampling (Uniform, Normal, Exponential, Triangular, Custom)  
- *(Upcoming)* Module 5: Matrix Algebra & Linear Systems  
- *(Upcoming)* Module 6: Broadcasting & Vectorization  

## üß† Key Skills Practiced

- Element-wise comparisons, Boolean masks, and filtering  
- Controlled randomness with `np.random.seed()`  
- Sampling from real distributions (normal, exponential, etc.)  
- Converting between arrays, lists, and dictionaries  
- Preparing reproducible simulations and model inputs  

## üöÄ Why This Repo Exists

This project is part of a broader goal to become a highly capable Python developer with a strong foundation in numerical programming, applied data science, and quant modeling.

All code is written through time-boxed learning sprints to simulate real project conditions: fast iteration, clean outputs, and continuous progress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter & VS Code (local development)  
- GitHub for version control and visibility
